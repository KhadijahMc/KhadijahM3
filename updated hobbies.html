      <h2>Creative & Personal Interests</h2>
      <p>I enjoy expressing myself through creative outlets such as journaling, music, and design. These hobbies allow me to stay grounded, inspired, and balanced while pursuing my educational and professional goals.</p>

      <h2>Community Involvement</h2>
      <p>Being involved in my community is very important to me. I often volunteer at local outreach events, participate in church activities, and help organize school-related drives and programs that support families in need.</p>

      <h2>Family & Personal Growth</h2>
      <p>Spending quality time with my family brings me joy and motivation. I also dedicate time to self-improvementâ€”whether it's reading personal development books, attending workshops, or setting new goals for myself.</p>
